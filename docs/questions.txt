alright, have a good night bra
[17.09.12 20:53:08] Kyle: So question 1, machines can have multiple build sizes, the 'standard' bed is 200x200mm and then the Z axis is usually 100mm some people do more...others use 150x150...but that's sorta outdated.

question 2. Most machines nowadays print PLA, or ABS...Nylon is an experimental material some people are playing with and HDPE, but nylon produces hydrogen cyanide when it melts, and HDPE is a pain in the ass, so PLA and ABS is where it's at. Some machines (professional) can print multiple materials at the same time, and some people are using "dual extruder" designs, so they can print different colours at the same time or different materials.

question 3. nozels are removable, but that's a pain in the ass, so people usually don't do it, and stick with what they bought. The problem here is that when you generate gcode, it's all specified to one nozeldiameter.
[17.09.12 20:58:01] Kyle: as for the operators. It when you make a 3d file, then process it, it gets 'sliced' into layers and then each layer is turned into gcode lines, that the machines reads and then prints the object, one layer at a time...So when a person wants something printed, right off the bat the operator has to decide things to make the thing actually print. layer height, infill (as it's a waste of plastic to literally fill an object 100% full of plastic, parts are printed mostly empty or at a certain percentage) and some other parameters...if a user is inexperienced, they won't have a f'n clue what settings will work to make the object they want printed..actually print. So it's better to have the person who has experience with the printer decide what settings are needed.
[17.09.12 20:58:27] Kyle: However, there might be the odd user here and there, who know all that kinda shit, and want something printed, and know what kind of infill they want.
[17.09.12 20:58:39] Kyle: or whatever else.
[17.09.12 20:59:40] Kyle: sorry, I didn't read the rest of what you wrote before I wrote all that, Yeah print settings...material maybe not so much..it's fairly popular the properties of either plastic. And alot of people only print in one or the other.
