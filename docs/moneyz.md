--Payment option
--------
* Percentage.
	This works by having the user upload the thing they want, an operator will then do whatever they need to get a quote, send this to the user, user accepts, then the operator makes the part, ships it away, finished.
User pays Us from a generated paypal link and or stripe

* eichhornchen takes in % (maybe 5-8) for fees or 2$ whichever is more.

* Money is disburst to users after a specific sum (50$ or more) However operators can ask for it earlier.

* Sales are final. Operators can offer warrenties, (this is either up to the operator or standard across the entire site)

* No fees for signs up


---Bid
* This is what jon said, a user uploads a file, then operators make bids on the print objects once the user accepts an operator costs and etc are decided privately between the two, eich. takes percentage on the print, win win on both ends.
* I think taking a percentage, and dealing with the funds entirely, and only paying out to users afterwards will be successful.
