* Percentage.
This works by having the user upload the thing they want choose operator, an operator will then do whatever they need to get a quote. 
  * Quotes are difficult because it's nigh impossible to know how long an object will take to print. 
  * Maybe an operator simple charges whatever after the print is finished. But gives a recommended price, however user is warned prices may be higher/lower
  * User pays Us from a generated paypal link and or stripe

* eichhornchen takes in % (maybe 5-8) for fees or 2$ whichever is more.

* Money is disburst to users after a specific sum (50$ or more) However operators can ask for it earlier.
^ Not sure how complicated this is.
* Sales are final. Operators can offer warrenties, (this is either up to the operator or standard across the entire site)

* No fees for signs up

* Nobody gets burned possibilities. Operators shouldn't be able to just not do jack because of rating system and the fact we hold cash.


---Bid
* This is what jon said, a user uploads a file, then operators make bids on the print objects once the user accepts an operator costs and etc are decided privately between the two, eich. takes percentage on the print, win win on both ends.
* I think taking a percentage, and dealing with the funds entirely, and only paying out to users afterwards will be successful.
