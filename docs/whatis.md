What is Eich?
===
Eichhornchen is the answer to a couple different questions.
* It's the Answer to "What am I going to do with my printers idle time?"
* It's the Answer to "How do I make a little money with this thing?"
* It's the Answer to "I don't know how to make a printer, or want do. But I want cheap prototypes."
* It's the Answer to "I don't know where to look for users! (Or for people who own printers!)
* and so forth

As you can see, Eichhornchen answers all sorts of situations. But to the get to the real point, It's connecting People together.
Eich. wants to provide an easy place for people to connect with others who own printing machines. We want to help spread the every increasing fast prototyping, 
Idea building machine better than ever before.

Here at Eich, People, Hackerspaces, and Businessnes, who are into the rapid prototyping scene (or just want to bring imagination to reality) can bring their services 
to the masses easily and affordably.
