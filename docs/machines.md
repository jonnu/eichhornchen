* Can be hackerspaces hackerspaces.org...send emails/mass mails to all hackerspaces
* Can be business


---MACHINES---
--------------

* Contact infos, email, address, real names, username, blah blah.

* Profiles (even if just basic)
	
* Location
	
* Machine specs.
	* Machine type, (custom, production machine, rostock, i3, i2, mendelmax, blah)
	* Build size (200x200x75 mm, etc)
	* Materials available to print (pla, abs, [can be sorted by colours])
	* nozel diametre. 0.75,0.5, 0.35

* Operators receive objects once a user selects them, and get a download link of file in a queue system. They do whatever needs to be done to build the object, if they have issues, they can contact user through internal messaging system to fix problems. Or to say object has been accepted and is in queue to be printed. once object is printed, and shipped, operators should send tracking number to user

* Queue system should show names of objects in the queue, but only allow in a 'first come first serve' download order. (to make things fair to users, maybe?)


* Prices equations recommended to machines...machines then make up quote to user. Machines don't print until user has agreed/paid. --This may be a difficult part, how do we get our cut? machines won't know prices (without expierence) how much a part costs until printed...perhaps recommended prices should be displayed to user, then once printed machines send paypal request)
