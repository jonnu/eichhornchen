* Operators receive objects once a user selects them, and get a download link of file in a queue system. They do whatever needs to be done to build the object, if they have issues, they can contact user through internal messaging system to fix problems. Or to say object has been accepted and is in queue to be printed. once object is printed, and shipped, operators should send tracking number to user
This depends on which system eich uses for payment, bidding or strict percentages
* Queue system should show names of objects in the queue, but only allow in a 'first come first serve' download order. (to make things fair to users, maybe?)


* 13 per print / 6.50 per hour is recommended rate.
