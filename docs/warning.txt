To Users ---maybe?---

Warning: The prices of your object can change. Due to the nature of how 3d printers work, it is impossible to 
accurately guess how long a particular print will take to print your part. Because of this, prices first quoted
to a user are 'rough' at best, and should be expected to change. 
	


	It is highly recommended users do as much as possible to ensure their part can be printed successfully.

To Operators ---maybe?---


Calculate costs based on your machine and fairness. Remember Users can rate Operators. If you're unsure what to charge
Eich has recommended prices below.


	For Regular Prints	
		10x per print plus 5.00 per hour*
	
		*Incase of machine failure (hardware, hotend clogging, etc) No additional costs to user
		*Incase of print failure (bad .STL files, difficult geometries) We recommend an addtional 
		 5x per hour on top of material fees.



	For Large Prints/High probability of failure prints
		15.50x per print plus 6x per hour*
			
		*Incase of machine failure (hardware, hotend clogging, etc) No additional costs to user
		*Incase of print of failure (bad .STL files, difficult geometries, multiple tries to get print settings correct) 
		 We recommend an additional 6 on top of material fees.



**It is highly recommend Operators run .STLs first through netfabb, regardless what the user has told you.
**It is highly recommended Operators do print a portional print test first for large/complicated prints.
