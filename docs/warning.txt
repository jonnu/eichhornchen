To Users ---maybe?---

Warning: The prices of your object can change. Due to the nature of how 3d printers work, it is impossible to 
accurately guess how long a particular print will take to print your part. Because of this, prices first quoted
to a user are 'rough' at best, and should be expected to change. 
	

	Eich recommends: 

		13x per print and 6.50x per hour of print, Reprints cost 4x per hour on top of material fees.
		Large and or complicated parts with high chance of failure cost 18.50x per print with 6x per hour.
		Should a reprint be required there is an additional 6x on top of material fees.


	It is highly recommended users do as much as possible to ensure their part can be printed successfully.

To Operators ---maybe?---


Warning: When calculating costs of prints be aware of Eichhorns recommended prices


	For Regular Prints	
		13x per print plus 6.50 per hour*
	
		*Incase of machine failure (hardware, hotend clogging, etc) No additional costs to user
		*Incase of print failure (bad .STL files, impossible geometries) We recommend an addtional 
		 4x per hour on top of material fees.



	For Large Prints/High probability of failure prints
		18.50x per print plus 6x per hour*
			
		*Incase of machine failure (hardware, hotend clogging, etc) No additional costs to user
		*Incase of print of failure (bad .STL files, impossible geometries, multiple tries to get print settings correct) 
		 We recommend an additional 6 on top of material fees.



**It is highly recommend Operators run .STLs first through netfabb, regardless what the user has told you.
**It is highly recommended Operators do print a portional print test first for large/complicated prints.
