---USERS---
-------------------
* Contact, email shipping address.
	
* Location (can be taking from shipping address)
	
* temporary accounts checkmark (some users might only want to print one thing and full registration may be too much (expire after 60 days)
	
* Plastic to have object printed in, (PLA, ABS)
	
* A note as to whether user is experienced in 3d printing or not
* If experienced
	* check marks as to how user wants parts printed
	* nozel size, infill, printed material, layer height
* Unexperienced 
	* Operators decides everything

* Upload for object: object should have a short description from user example "This is a banana"

* Once object is uploaded, Location system required

* Users educated on pricing (shipping estimates) Printing costs generaly "x per print, Y per hour" 
	
* Location system finds nearest machine (maybe prioritize by least active machine
	* Can be sorted by users with dropdown menu, (highest rated user, closest, least active, blah )
	
* Upload system can leave uploaded objects there, this way if a user wants to be able to come back and 'order' a part they just have to select part, nearest machine, and then finished.
	* Handy for high wear parts like magic arms
