PRINT SYSTEM

definitions
users - people who want something printed
machines - people who have 3d printers.
Operators - people who run the 3d printers

---What We need--
Registration for users and machines
	users --- people who want something printed
	
	machines --- machines available
	
	location system for matching local users to local machines (or nearest)
		may be 'located' through currency as the second method of locating (euro, CAD, USD, etc).
	
	A form of user support from machines to users. (or us to both)
	
	Likely a basic forum atleast for whatever. (might help to keep users/machines active)
	
	a recommendation/rate system for users to rate machines, This'll remove shitty machines
	
	Active machines will have backlogs of parts to print. the location system should note this, and recommend machines within same currency who are less active. This'll help make more machines active, cut down on production time for the website as a whole.

	A Database of general shipping costs from around places.

--Method of making money--
Percentages - With a percentage, the website might just turn into a place for people to easily find each other then abandon. However this helps keep less active machines around.

monthly fees - setting a monthly fee for machines...this'll keep members around (cause they paid) But has a problem of inactivity for some areas. However, active members will enjoy a lowish fee with many users and high profits. <--- active machines would be inclined to own several printers.

People generally sell their plastic parts on an equation of material cost + print time some 'sets' go for 100$ each.

This equation is hard because plastic is sold ad wildly different prices, and depending in 'infill' of a 3d printed object any one part can take from a half hour to hours in printing.
Most people seem to say, 10 per print + 5 per hour, this is currency agnostic and also relatively cheap. Others charge more if they only own one machine, and much more for parts that have a high potential to fail.


USERS - required things from them

	Contact, email shipping address.
	
	Location (can be taking from shipping address)
	
	temporary accounts checkmark (some users might only want to print one thing and full registration may be too much (expire after 60 days)
	
	Plastic to have object printed in, (PLA, ABS)
	
	A note as to whether user is experienced in 3d printing or not
		If experienced
			check marks as to how user wants parts printed
			nozel size, infill, printed material, layer height
		Unexperienced
			machine decides everything

	Upload for object.
		object should have a short description from user

	Once object is uploaded, Location system required
	
	Location system finds nearest machine (maybe prioritize by least active machine
		Can be sorted by users with dropdown menu, (highest rated user, closest, least active, blah )
	
	Upload system can leave uploaded objects there, this way if a user wants to be able to come back and 'order' a part they just have to select part, nearest machine,
	and then finished. (much like other systems like ponoko) 

--Or users never interact with machines. This may take complexity out of the system, where the machine operator chooses everything (except printed material) But is harder for estimating prices and less open..


Machines
Contact infos, email, address, real names, username, blah blah.

	Location
	
	Machine specs.
		Machine type, (custom, production machine, rostock, i3, i2, mendelmax, blah)
		Build size
		Materials available to print (pla, abs, [can be sorted by colours])
		nozel diametre. 0.5, 0.35

	Operators receive objects once a user selects them, and get a download link of file in a queue system. They do whatever needs to be done to build the object, if they have issues, they can contact user through internal messaging system to fix problems. Or to say object has been accepted and is in queue to be printed.
	
	once object is printed, and shipped, operators should send tracking number to user

	Queue system should show names of objects in the queue, but only allow in a 'first come first serve' download order. (to make things fair)

------EXTRA-----

STOCK PILE
Some things are very common to be printed out, these are mainly sets for printer parts.
	 A user selects what machine they want, i3, rostock, prusa i2, mendel max, blah blah, and can order right away, no hassle.


These can be stock piled for users to simply click on and order (this can be done be us(me)) But also by machines.

3d DESIGN

Some people are worthless at designing things, this can be a place for people to design and print for others. This increases costs drastically.
