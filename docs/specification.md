PRINT SYSTEM
-----------------
definitions
* users - people who want something printed
* machines - people who have 3d printers.
* Operators - people who run the 3d printers

---What We need---
-----------------
Registration for users and machines
* users --- people who want something printed
	
* machines --- machines available
	
* location system for matching local users to local machines (or nearest)
		may be 'located' through currency as the second method of locating (euro, CAD, USD, etc).
	
* A form of user support from machines to users. (or us to both)
	
* Likely a basic forum atleast for whatever. (might help to keep users/machines active)
	
* a recommendation/rate system for users to rate machines, This'll remove shitty machines
	
* Active machines will have backlogs of parts to print. the location system should note this, and recommend machines within same currency who are less active. This'll help make more machines active, cut down on production time for the website as a whole.



---Method of making money---
-----------------
 see moneyz



---EXPANSION---
--------
* Adding other types of cnc machines, (plotters, mills, lathes) there is a huge market of cnc machines out there that have idle timeshould not have to stick to just 3d printing.
	



---EXTRA---
-----
* STOCK PILE
Some things are very common to be printed out, these are mainly sets for printer parts.
	 A user selects what machine they want, i3, rostock, prusa i2, mendel max, blah blah, and can order right away, no hassle.
* Part of stock pile idea, People can use website to sell things they make often, we take percentage cut.


* These can be stock piled for users to simply click on and order (this can be done be us(me)) But also by machines.

* 3d DESIGN

Some people are worthless at designing things, this can be a place for people to design and print for others. This increases costs drastically. and maybe site activity.

* BLOG

Typical blog for keeping users updated...writing tips and and other stuff. (websites like Ponoko are fairly active at this and . So this doesn't have to be a backbreaker to compete.
